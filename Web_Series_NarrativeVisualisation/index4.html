  <p>
    For this Narrative Visualization Project, I have analyzed a web series dataset to study which genres and ratings have appealed to viewers' interests over the years. 
    The original dataset for this Narrative Visualization has been taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muralidharbhusal/50000-imdb-tv-and-web-series.
    The dataset was cleaned to remove irrelevant data and ensure data integrity. We also added some additional fields to the dataset to make it more informative.
    The dataset includes fields such as series title, runtime, genre, rating, decade, release year, end year, duration, cast, and synopsis. 
    The flow of this Narrative Visualization is as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>Scene 1: Web Series Popularity over the Decades</li>
      <li>Scene 2: Web Series Distribution across top-10 Genres for each decade</li>
      <li>Scene 3: Average Rating of Web Series for top-10 Genres for each decade</li>
      <li>Scene 4: Evolution of User Preferences over the Decades based on our Analysis</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
