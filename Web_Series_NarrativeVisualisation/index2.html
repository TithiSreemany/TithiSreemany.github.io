    <p>
      For this Narrative Visualization Project, I have analyzed a web series dataset to study which genres and ratings have appealed to viewers' interests over the years. 
      The original dataset for this Narrative Visualization has been taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muralidharbhusal/50000-imdb-tv-and-web-series.
      The dataset was cleaned to remove irrelevant data and ensure data integrity. We also added some additional fields to the dataset to make it more informative.
      The dataset includes fields such as series title, runtime, genre, rating, decade, release year, end year, duration, cast, and synopsis. 
      The flow of this Narrative Visualization is as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>Scene 1: Web Series Popularity over the Decades</li>
        <li>Scene 2: Web Series Distribution across top-10 Genres for each decade</li>
        <li>Scene 3: Average Rating of Web Series for top-10 Genres for each decade</li>
        <li>Scene 4: Evolution of User Preferences over the Decades based on our Analysis</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

    <p>
      In the second scene of the Interactive Visualization, we create a donut chart showing the distribution of web series with rating>5. The chart shows the top-10 genres in which the web series for the selected decade, and the rest of the genres are grouped together under "Other". 
      The chart is interactive and allows the user to select the decade of interest ranging from 1950-1960 to 2010-2020 and the donut chart is updated dynamically according to the chosen year. 
      The color-scheme to represent the Web Series Genres remains consistent across the decades for easier comparison.
      The chart is also annotated with the number of web series in each genre and the contribution percentage of each genre. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The chart is useful for understanding the popularity of different genres over the years and how the distribution of genres has evolved over time.
